        Distributed Redis client
        ========================
        
        Distributed Redis Client (disredis) to enable real-time failover of 
        redis masters to paired slaves. This enables us use redis in places 
        where higher reliability is needed.
        
        The DisredisClient class can be used in place of a StrictRedis client. 
        Instead of passing the host and port in, pass in a list of Sentinel addresses in
        the form of "host:port". It will connect to the first responding Sentinel
        and query it for masters that it knows about. These masters will become the
        nodes that are sharded across. As long as the number of masters does not
        change, the sharding will be stable even if there is a node failure.
        
        Node failures are handled by asking the Sentinel for the updated master of
        the given node. During the initial failure, some request may error out
        with a ConnectionError if they are made between when the node fails and
        when Sentinel executes the fail-over procedure.
        
        Redis and Sentinel Configuration
        ================================
        
        We recommend using at least Redis version 2.6.13.
        
        For testing you need a minimum of two sentinels and two redis instances 
        (one master and one slave) to test fail over.
        
        For production we recommend at least two servers. Each server should run 
        two sentinels and at least one master and one slave redis instance, 
        running on opposite servers.
        
            |   Server One   |    |   Server Two   |
            |----------------|    |----------------|
            | Sentinel01     |    | Sentinel03     |
            | Sentinel02     |    | Sentinel04     |
            | Redis01-Master |    | Redis01-Slave  |
            | Redis02-Slave  |    | Redis02-Master |
            | ...            |    | ...            |
        
        **Important:** If you are running on AWS please ensure your django servers 
        can connect to the internal IP of the AWS redis servers. AWS ec2 instances 
        resolve to their internal IP which results in sentinels returning the 
        internal IP when queried. To check the IP address of redis instances run 
        the following command:
        
            redis-cli -p <SENTINEL PORT, e.g. 26379> sentinel masters
        
        Example Sentinel Configuration:
        
            port  26379 #Sentinel Port
        
            sentinel monitor redis-Redis1 server1.com 6382 2
            sentinel down-after-milliseconds redis-Redis1 60000
            sentinel failover-timeout redis-Redis1 900000
            sentinel can-failover redis-Redis1 yes
            sentinel parallel-syncs redis-Redis1 1
        
            sentinel monitor redis-Redis2 server2.com 6383 2
            sentinel down-after-milliseconds redis-Redis2 60000
            sentinel failover-timeout redis-Redis2 900000
            sentinel can-failover redis-Redis2 yes
            sentinel parallel-syncs redis-Redis2 1
        
        Please check the redis documentation for more details on Redis and 
        Sentinel installation and configuration.
        
        We also recommend using Supervisor or similar to manage the various 
        Redis and Sentinel instances.
        
        Django Setup
        ============
        
        Either download from github and run
            
            python setup.py install
        
        or
        
            pip install disredis
        
        Add the disredis code to the django app.
        
        Add the following to django settings
        
            SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 2592000 # thirty days - Adjust to your needs
        
            SESSION_REDIS_PREFIX = '<REPLACE - e.g. mysessions>'
            SESSION_REDIS_HOST = 'localhost'
            SESSION_REDIS_DB = 6
        
            SESSION_ENGINE = 'disredis_sessions.session'
        
            SESSION_REDIS_SENTINEL_URLS = [
                'SENTINEL_SERVER:SENTINEL_PORT',
                ...]
        
        Restart django to start using Redis for user sessions
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        Ensure the django application servers can connect to the redis 
        and sentinel ports.
        
        Run the following command on the redis servers to check all 
        redis instances are listed (check IP and master/slave status):
        
            $ redis-cli -p <SENTINEL PORT, e.g. 26379> sentinel master
